ICLV model:

Joint probability of observing all 6 frustration ratings & 3 route choices

For every Individual


USEFUL TIP:
In complex models like ICLV, always keep the average value of Xs between 3.5 - 4.0

I saw this thing making a difference in my model.

CASE I: Xbar(TT) ~ 3.5 and Xbar(VRC) ~ 0.6 --> SE were too big
CASE II: Xbar(TT) ~ 3.5 and Xbar(VRC) ~ 3.0 --> SE were small
